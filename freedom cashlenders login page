In fact, payday and other short-term cash advance loans are so expensive and potentially dangerous that some states have banned them completely. Many other states have strong restrictions on payday loans, though some unscrupulous companies can often find loopholes that allow them to still overcharge or over-lend.

Unlike installment loans, which are repaid through bi-monthly or monthly payments, short-term loans, including payday loans, are generally repaid in a single lump sum. You’ll not only need to pay the entire principal amount (what you borrowed), but you’ll need to pay any and all finance charges, too.

Those charges are no joke, either. The typical annual interest rate on a payday loan is in the three digits, with finance charges usually ranging between $10 and $30 per $100 you borrow, depending on your credit and the length of your loan. It’s the high fees that can be the biggest danger of a payday loan.
